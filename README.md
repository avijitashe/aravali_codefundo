An Open Source System Prototype to predict, prevent, or manage the impact of natural disasters. This is for codefundo++ 2018.

Synopsis
CWC, a national body, has a flood forecasting network spread across India (india-wris.nrsc.gov.in/wrpinfo/index.php?title=CWC_National_Flood_Forecasting_Network ). According to the figures, poor prediction results from false positives. When there are a lot of false warnings, it creates unnecessary panic among citizens and widespread chaos for moving army, relief and preparedness. Not to mention, a lot of financial resources are spent too.
